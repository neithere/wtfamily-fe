* PlaceViewer

  * Filter by timeline (before/after)

    * Challenge: no filtering by event date in RESTful API or on model level.
      To implement, we need:

      a) iterate all events and places â€” expensive
      b) a complex MongoDB query
      c) pre-build index: PlaceIdsByEventYear or something like that
